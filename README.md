# Hardware-Security-FPGA implementation

# What's this ? 
  Hardware imlementation of AES encryption algorithm based on In memory computing architecture targeting high throughput and low power consumption applications.  
 
VHDL has been chosen for this purpose and various simulations have been actualized to verify the correctness of the algorithm, using an appositely customized testbench.
All results are based on simulations from Vivado tools and all encryptions transformations are simulated using XILINX FPGA family, NEXYS 4
DDR, Artix-7, FPGA board family.  

A more detailed documentation of the AES-128 architecture is available in the paper bellow.
